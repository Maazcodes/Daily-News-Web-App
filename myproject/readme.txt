This is a news web app like times of india. 

It displays news of categories like sports, technology, health, science, business, entertainment, etc.
I have not used database tables in this project.
I have used mainly bootstrap to enhance front end features of this mini project.

Things learnt:
1) To set the objects in center, set style as margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto.
2) We can pack and unback objects while iteration using built in template tags, here, for loop
